# JS Native Item list app

Web app with add, delete and edit functionality and item draggability.

Features:
- Add item with item name, description and photograph
- Drag and drop list sorting
- Item counter
- Edit item description and image
- Stored list state

Done with vanilla JS and Jquery. Added JSON/Html converter, pure JS library.

The session storage strategy is based in localStorage, so if at any point a "reset" is needed, just run localStorage.clear() in your console.
